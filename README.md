Followed a tutorial for creating my first angular 2 app with JWT authentication on the backend.

# Angular
Project uses Angular on the frontend. Uses the new router with guards to deny unauthorized users access to certain routes/components

# NodeJS/Express/Mongoose

Uses Express and mongoose as the backend for API calls to register and authenticate users along with Passport.JS to handle the auth strategy.
Mongoose is used as user storage.
